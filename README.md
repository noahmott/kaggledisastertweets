# kaggledisastertweets
A basic Machine Learning project using the Kaggle Disaster Tweets dataset and the XGBoost classifier.
This project utilized a Machine Learning algorithm called the Extreme Gradient Boost or XGBoost classifier. The purpose of the distaster tweets dataset is to properly identify tweets as being either about an actual disaster or not. This project utilized some Natural Language Processing to clean, lemmatize, and strip the text. I then applied the algorithm to make predictions. The resulting predictions and accuracy can be seen here:
